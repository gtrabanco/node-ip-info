Use `dependencies` of `package.json` file in your own project `package.json`. I suggest to rename it and recreate one, later copy it to your own generated `package.json` and run `npm install`.

Do not know why but fails the logger morgan then typescript is converted to js.

If you know why, please tell me in an issue.

Thank you.

Gulpjs copied from a yeoman express-typescript generator.

There are a lot of things that can be improved.
